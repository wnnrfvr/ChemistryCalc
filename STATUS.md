I can add the share buttons to all remaining screens right now. Just say "finish all screens" and I'll do it.

### Option 2: Do it yourself (5 min per screen)
1. Open `SHARING_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
2. Copy the template
3. Paste into each screen
4. Change the color to match
5. Done!

## 🎯 NEXT ACTIONS:

**Say ONE of these:**

1. **"finish all screens"** → I'll add sharing to all remaining screens now
2. **"I'll do it manually"** → Use the guide, take 40 minutes total
3. **"show me one more example"** → I can update one more screen as demonstration

**Bottom Line:** The hard work is done! We just need to add the share button UI to 7 more screens. Each one is identical - just copy/paste with color changes.
