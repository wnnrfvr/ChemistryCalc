## 📊 REMAINING SIMULATOR/EDUCATIONAL SCREENS

These screens are NOT traditional calculators with step-by-step solutions. They need different sharing approaches:

### To Add (Simple Text Share):

1. **GasesScreen.js** - Needs visual/interactive sharing
2. **MassMoleNumberScreen.js** - Simple converter (less critical for sharing)
3. **SolutionChemistryScreen.js** - Similar to others (can add later)
4. **ThemoChem.js** - Similar to others (can add later)
5. **ChemistryCalculatorScreen.js** - Multi-calculator (can add later)

**These can be handled manually using the guide I provided.** They follow the EXACT same pattern.
